2009.03.06:
* Because a bug in RS ECC of jz4740 that reading all 0xff data in one NAND page 
  will occur uncorrectalbe ECC error, we should detect whether the data in a page 
  is all 0xff or not by seeing if there is no-zero ECC in oob, instead of using 
  the old method which is seeing if there is no-0xff in the 3rd, 4th or 5th byte 
  in oob.
