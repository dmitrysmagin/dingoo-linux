This little program is inteded to fix a dump of the first eraseblock
of NAND as written by linux (using forced 2K page size), so that the
IPL in ROM reads the SPL.

Linux stores the ECC information at offset 28 in the OOB, while the
IPL expects it to be at offset 6. In addition, IPL won't read the
SPL unless bytes at offsets 2 to 4 are set to 0x00.
