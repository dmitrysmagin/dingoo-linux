Some notes on this release:

- make a320_defconfig for a default configuration (LCD driver ILI9325).

- If your A320 is one of the newer models, you must change the LCD driver
  to ILI9331:

    Device drivers
    |---Graphics support
        |---Support for framebuffer devices
            |---SLCD panel

- Sound driver is still OSS. It's quite buggy, but stick to S16 sample
  format and everything should be ok.

- IPU (Image Processing Unit) memory reservation at startup is disabled
  (saves 4MB). If you intend to test video playing, you might want to
  enable it:

    General setup
    |---Configure standard kernel features (for small sytems)
        |---Reserve memory for IPU on Ingenic JZ4740 SOC

- CPU frequency scaling is now default enabled. Have a look at the stuff
  in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/. Default governor is "userspace".
  It is untested, and anyway at the moment you can only REDUCE the CPU
  frequency below the 336MHz set by the boot hardware initialization code
  (in hwinit if you're booting v√≠a USB boot).

- Lots of JZ4740 hardware support is disabled. Not because it doesn't
  work but because it is untested. Enable it at your own risk.
