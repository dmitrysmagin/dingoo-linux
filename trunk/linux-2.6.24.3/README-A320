----------------
** Quickstart **
----------------

Use "make a320_defconfig" for a default configuration (LCD driver ILI9325).

If your A320 is one of the newer models, you must change the LCD driver
to ILI9331:

    Device drivers
    |---Graphics support
        |---Support for framebuffer devices
            |---SLCD panel

--------------
** Keyboard **
--------------

The keyboard driver has been completely rewritten now using the polled
input device code. The standard keyboard map is as follows:

    D-pad up            KEY_UP          KEY_VOLUMEUP            's'
    D-pad down          KEY_DOWN        KEY_VOLUMEDOWN          'u'
    D-pad left          KEY_LEFT        KEY_BRIGHTNESSDOWN      'e'
    D-pad right         KEY_RIGHT       KEY_BRIGHTNESSUP        'i'
    A button            KEY_LEFTCTRL
    B button            KEY_LEFTATL
    X button            KEY_SPACE
    Y button            KEY_LEFTSHIFT
    Left shoulder       KEY_TAB
    Right shoulder      KEY_BACKSPACE
    START button        KEY_ENTER
    SELECT button       KEY_ESC         KEY_KEYBOARD		'b'

The second column is the generated keycode when the button is pressed normally.
The third column is the generated keycode when the button is pressed while the
power slider is pressed too.
The fourth column is the generated system request when the button is pressed
while both the power slider and the START button are pressed:

's'	Emergency sync of all discs.
'u'	Remount all discs read-only.
'e'	Send SIGTERM to all processes except init.
'i'	Send SIGKILL to all processes except init.
'b'	Reboot immediately.

For example, to reboot the console syncing all disces and mounting read-only,
press and hold POWER, press and hold START, and press secuentially UP, DOWN
and SELECT. Note that SELECT is also used in dual-boot to select linux boot,
so if you hold SELECT pressed at the end of the previous sequence, you should
reboot back into linux.

Note that the POWER + key combinations are selected to enable an user space
daemon handle the volume, LCD bightness, and perhaps an on-screen keyboard.

If you hold the power slider pressed alone this is what will happen:
- After two seconds a KEY_POWER key press and release will be generated.
- After five seconds, an inmediate reboot will happen.

This is subject to change when hardware powerdown or idle support works.

I did my best to come up with a clever and useful keyboard map, but if you
have any suggestions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

** Sound **
-----------

Sound driver is still OSS. It's quite buggy, but stick to S16 sample
format and everything should be ok.

---------------------------------
** IPU (Image Processing Unit) **
---------------------------------

IPU (Image Processing Unit) memory reservation at startup is disabled
(saves 4MB). If you intend to test video playing, you might want to
enable it:

    General setup
    |---Configure standard kernel features (for small sytems)
        |---Reserve memory for IPU on Ingenic JZ4740 SOC

---------------------------
** CPU frequency scaling **
---------------------------

CPU frequency scaling is now default enabled. Have a look at the stuff
in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/. Default governor is "userspace".
It is untested, and anyway at the moment you can only REDUCE the CPU
frequency below the 336MHz set by the boot hardware initialization code
(in hwinit if you're booting v√≠a USB boot).

-------------
** Battery **
-------------

The easiest way to read the battery level is by using the procfs
interface: just reading from /proc/jz/battery. The obtained value is the
direct reading from the analog to digital converter.

You can also use IOCTL command 0 on char devide major 238 and minor 12.
The Ingenic code does not comply with the sysfs standard and thus you
won't seet this device in /dev unless you manually create it:

mknod /dev/jz-sadc c 238 12

I suggest you use the /proc/jz/battery interface and forget about the
ioctl. I'll probably remove it eventually, because if properly done,
would require a kernel header with the IOCTL command definitions.

I don't know much yet about how the read value translates into battery
level. As developers report on this issue the information will be
published.

The procfs interface IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE. In particular, dingux is
intended to support several devices, and the direct conversion values read
may be different for each. In order to be platform independent, the
definitive interface should return, for example, a percentage of full
battery charge.

-------------------
** Miscellaneous **
-------------------

Lots of JZ4740 hardware support is disabled. Not because it doesn't
work but because it is untested. Enable it at your own risk.
