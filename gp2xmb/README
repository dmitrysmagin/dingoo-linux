INTRODUCTION

  `GP2XMB' is an alternative launcher for the GP2X, with the same visual
  layout as the Sony Cross Media Bar.

  GP2XMB is currently under heavy development and you are encouraged to try
  out the latest version and come with new suggestions and patches to improve
  the quality of the software.

  The following features should be included in GP2XMB in the future:

    - Game Launcher (Divided into a shortcut lanucher and a browser)
    - Photo Viewer (Close to finished, only minor things and bugs left)
    - Music Player (A simple Vorbis player, libmad support in the future)
    - Video Player (Pre-design, Currently uses the internal player)
    - Settings Menu (Various settings implemented)

INSTALLATION

  Installing GP2XMB is fairly straight forward.

    - unpack the binary release to a directory
    - create a new folder (gp2xmb) anywhere on your SD memory stick
    - copy the file `gp2xmb.gpe' from the unpacked directory to this folder
    - copy the directory `images' from the unpacked directory to this folder
    - copy the directory `sound' from the unpacked directory to this folder

  Then launch the application from your current launcher.
